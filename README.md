# Easy Creature Add-on for Blender

## Description
Easy Creature enhances Blender's modeling workflow, automating the application of Mirror, Skin, and Subdivision Surface modifiers for character and creature design. This tool streamlines the creation process from simple to complex organic shapes.

## Important Usage Note
Optimized for starting from minimal geometry (such as a single vertex), this add-on simplifies the progression to detailed models. However, it's less suited for pre-existing complex geometries, where performance and mesh management might be challenging.

### Key Modifier Adjustments
#### Adjusting Mirror Modifier for Seamless Symmetry
The Merge Distance in the Mirror modifier settings may need fine-tuning to ensure mirrored elements merge properly, creating seamless symmetry from a minimal geometry starting point.

#### Achieving Smooth Shading with Skin Modifier
For models with the Skin modifier, the conventional Shade Smooth option via right-click won't be effective. Instead, use the **Smooth Shading** button within the Skin modifier's settings for the desired smoothness.

#### Setting Up Symmetry with the Skin Modifier
For symmetrical growth when using the Skin modifier, it's crucial to define the central axis of symmetry. This can be done by selecting a middle vertex on your model and clicking the **Mark Root** button in the Skin modifier's settings. This action sets the selected vertex as the starting point for the skinning process, ensuring symmetrical development from the center outwards.

Incorporating these practices into your use of Easy Creature will enhance your efficiency in creating detailed, symmetrical, and smoothly shaded characters and creatures.

Thank you for incorporating Easy Creature into your Blender toolset!
